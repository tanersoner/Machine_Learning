    "This is a segmentation task that uses company sales data as the data basis. In this task, customers are to be divided into segments based on their purchasing behavior (customer segmentation). The main task is to identify relevant patterns in the purchasing behavior of customers. Several segmentation solutions are possible. The ones of particular importance to the company are those that are associated with a gain in customer insight, with implications for revenue and profit growth.\n",

    "In general, a customer segmentation is carried out so that customers can be addressed in a targeted manner or in order to offer suitable products and services to the customer. **Meaningful** differentiation criteria for the company would be the customer price sensitivity, the assortment mix (similarity of the articles purchased by the customer), seasonal buying behavior of the customer, etc."
